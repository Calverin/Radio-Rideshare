Radio Rideshare level formatting\n\n

Headers:\n
#TITLE: the title of the song\n
#ARTIST: the artist of the song\n
#MAPPER: the mapper of the song charting\n
#NPS: the notes per second of the level\n
#LANES: the number of lanes for the mapping\n\n

The #TITLE, #NPS, and #LANES headers are required for every level.\n
The #ARTIST and #MAPPER headers are not required, but are preferred.\n\n

The path for levels uses letters to represent obstacles and beats, with the following being already mapped:\n\n

0 -> nothing\n
1 -> car obstacle\n
2 -> standard beat\n
3 -> drfit left\n
4 -> drift right\n
5 -> end a drift segment\n
