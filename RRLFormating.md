Radio Rideshare level formatting.

Headers:
#TITLE: the title of the song
#ARTIST: the artist of the song
#MAPPER: the mapper of the song charting
#NPS: the notes per second of the level
#LANES: the number of lanes for the mapping

The #TITLE, #NPS, and #LANES headers are required for every level.
The #ARTIST and #MAPPER headers are not required, but are preferred.


The path for levels uses letters to represent obstacles and beats, with the following being already mapped:

0 -> nothing
1 -> car obstacle
2 -> standard beat
3 -> drfit left
4 -> drift right
5 -> end a drift segment
