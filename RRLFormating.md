Radio Rideshare level formatting.

Headers:
#TITLE: the title of the song
#ARTIST: the artist of the song
#MAPPER: the mapper of the song charting
#NPS: the notes per second of the level
#LANES: the number of lanes for the mapping

The #TITLE, #NPS, and #LANES headers are required for every level.
The #ARTIST and #MAPPER headers are not required, but are preferred.


The path for levels uses letters to represent obstacles and beats, with the following being already mapped:

0 -> nothing
1 -> standard beat
2 -> turn left
3 -> turn right
4 -> start left drift
5 -> end left drift
6 -> start right drift
7 -> end right drift
8 -> left spin-drift
9 -> right spin-drift
a -> car obstacle
