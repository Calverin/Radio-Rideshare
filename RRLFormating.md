Radio Rideshare level formatting<br /><br />

Headers:<br />
#TITLE: the title of the song<br />
#ARTIST: the artist of the song<br />
#MAPPER: the mapper of the song charting<br />
#NPS: the notes per second of the level<br />
#LANES: the number of lanes for the mapping<br /><br />

The #TITLE, #NPS, and #LANES headers are required for every level.<br />
The #ARTIST and #MAPPER headers are not required, but are preferred.<br /><br />

The path for levels uses letters to represent obstacles and beats, with the following being already mapped:<br />
0 -> nothing<br />
1 -> car obstacle<br />
2 -> standard beat<br />
3 -> drfit left<br />
4 -> drift right<br />
5 -> end a drift segment<br />
