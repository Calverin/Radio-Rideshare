Radio Rideshare
https://github.com/Calverin/Radio-Rideshare

Idea: An imitative-control rhythm game. Main triggers on the controller or buttons on laptop being a connection to tapping the steering wheel, flipping the left and right turn signals, flipping the windshield wipers, etc.
Example Controls: Left-Shift, S, D, Space, K, L, Right-Shift

The Story:
	We follow a non-descript rideshare service driver as they go about their days driving people around town. They sync their driving quirks to the songs playing, and they always let the rider control the aux. They try to not make mistakes or get slowed down in order to keep their reviews positive and their tips high.
	This game would allow for a level-editor. The idea behind the level-editing itself is simple enough, using a fixed path and adding obstacles, notes, etc, in order to simulate what the user would include as rests, crescendos, notes.
	The difficulty would come in turning this into 3-D representation for the visual aspect of the game. What could be done is to have the camera in a fixed position during gameplay, then allow for turns to be custom made and follow that similar path. This would trivialize the customization of the levels by keeping the heavy-lifting on the userâ€™s creativity, while having the camera and player kept to a simple track.
