Radio Rideshare

Idea: An imitative-control rhythm game. Main triggers on the controller or buttons on laptop being a connection to tapping the steering wheel, flipping the left and right turn signals, flipping the windshield wipers, etc.
Example Controls: Left-Shift, S, D, Space, K, L, Right-Shift

Design and Implementation: Using Godot 3-D Game Engine, written in a combination of GDScript and C#.

Style: Cel-Shaded Voxel Graphics. This would represent a simplistic and cartoonish style.

The Story:
	We follow a non-descript rideshare service driver as they go about their days driving people around town. They sync their driving quirks to the songs playing, and they always let the rider control the aux. They try to not make mistakes or get slowed down in order to keep their reviews positive and their tips high.
	This game would allow for a level-editor. The idea behind the level-editing itself is simple enough, using a fixed path and adding obstacles, notes, etc, in order to simulate what the user would include as rests, crescendos, notes.
	The difficulty would come in turning this into 3-D representation for the visual aspect of the game. What could be done is to have the camera in a fixed position during gameplay, then allow for turns to be custom made and follow that similar path. This would trivialize the customization of the levels by keeping the heavy-lifting on the userâ€™s creativity, while having the camera and player kept to a simple track.

Notes on the story:
	Currently waiting to see what people prefer in terms of story - something realistic or founded in a bit of obscurity. The goal is to create something that is fun to play, with a compelling story that drives the player to get through levels that they may not be having the easiest time with. With the goal of it being a difficult game with a story to keep the players interested in the gameplay loop.
	This requires we take polls and interest surveys of our fellow students. Results will be added in future commits, pending completion.

Required Aspects:
	 - Custom soundtrack and songlist
	 - 3-D models (for cars, player, characters, notes, obstacles, background)
	 - Sound effects
	 - Level editor and file reader to accompany
