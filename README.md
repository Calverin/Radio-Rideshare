Radio Rideshare

A car-based rhythm game where the player acts as a rideshare-servce driver as they go about their days in the rough-and-tumble streets of their city. Sync your driving quirks to notes on the road.
This game also has a custom level editor! Import your own songs and then access our built-in level editor to add in obstacles and notes.

Controls: Space bar to honk and hit tap notes, left shift and right shift to "drift" between lanes.
